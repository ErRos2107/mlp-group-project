    " - you can tell it which_year (09 or 15), since there are two different assist data sets, one from each year\n",
    " - For each batch, it produces inputs, targets AND target_ids.  The target_ids contain indices for extracting a predictions vector from the output of the RNN (exactly like the 2016-EDM code).\n",
    " - There is no .npz file for the validation set. Instead, we use k-fold cross validation by first constructing a DataProvider using the training data, and then calling get_k_folds method, which returns k tuples of DataProviders: (train_dp, val_dp)"
